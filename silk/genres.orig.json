Sandwiched on a bill between the jumpy Venezuelan rock band La Vida Boheme and the atmospheric pop outfit Polica, the poetry-slam veteran won the crowd over quickly (\"I'm gonna make y'all work as hard as I work today,\" he teased between songs) and then let his appropriately sugar-tongued, impeccable flow take it from there."

The goodwill kept flowing from there, with STS making light of his mid-afternoon time slot (\"I'm gonna keep saying 'tonight,' 'cause it's cooler\") by way of launching into an inspired take on his winning single \"Here Tonight.\" A major talent with high-profile endorsements â€” and a killer debut in 2011's The Illustrious â€” STS looks fully primed for \"We heard him when ... \" status."

There was the unlikely return of the ukulele, which took a starring role in one of the year's most fascinating and talked-about releases, the tUnE-yArDs album w h o k i l l. Wilco and Bright Eyes, each coming off a run of albums that divided fans, dropped career-defining records â€” no less odd or experimental than their predecessors, but packed top to bottom with hummable songs. The Roots seemed to spin a dense, story-driven concept album out of thin air, with barely a peep of advance press. And Neutral Milk Hotel's Jeff Mangum, missing in action for more than a decade, reemerged with a sold-out solo tour and heaps of previously unreleased music."

But, more importantly, Public Enemy proved to be current at All Tomorrow's Parties in Asbury Park, N.J. That's a funny thing to say about a two-hour set centered on the performance of a 20-year-old classic album, Fear of a Black Planet. But, when remixed and recontextualized, those songs were just a launching pad for one of the most entertaining sets of the weekend. With never a dull moment, Chuck D and Flavor Flav ran around the stage like young kids at a punk show. Simply put, Public Enemy still brings it. [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]"

She's one of those people who says something and you think, \"Wow,  I've had feelings like that before, but I've never been able to put them  into words so effortlessly.\" If you speak Spanish, do take a listen to the version of the show we  recorded in her native language. You'll note something very  interesting and very beautiful. On display in this podcast are three  extremely distinct accents: the Italian-influenced Argentine speech of  Jasmine Garsd, the courteous, warm Mexican-American constructions of  Felix Contreras and the unmistakable, crisp Andalucian accent that  emanates from Rodriguez herself. It makes me think of something Rodriguez said,  that she doesn't want to pigeonhole herself and say she only listens  to reggaeton, or jazz, or Chano Dominguez. No â€” she listens to music, and she makes music for all kinds of people. Alt.Latino is a show that serves the same purpose, and we're happy that the range of  voices in today's show reflects that diversity."

Gaye was singing to his generation in an effort to wake people up to the struggles no one was willing to discuss at that time. But these songs are universal; they've transcended their time and place. Listen carefully and you'll notice how much they still resonate."

Gaye's songs are filled with sophisticated yet instantly recognizable hooks and languid, jazz-inflected funk grooves that would keep anyone dancing and singing along. If it weren't for Gaye's skillful songcraft, his message might have been lost. Thankfully, 40 years later, this music lives on."

Released on May 21, 1971, the album is an introspective, politically charged nine-piece song cycle that addresses the ravages of the Vietnam War, urban decay, drug abuse, civil unrest and injustice. Gaye was singing to his generation in an effort to wake people up to the struggles no one was willing to discuss at that time. But these songs are universal; they've transcended their time and place. Listen carefully and you'll notice how much they still resonate."

What's Going On has become a template for how to marry a strong message with a pop sensibility in order to reach as large an audience as possible. Gaye's songs are filled with sophisticated yet instantly recognizable hooks and languid, jazz-inflected funk grooves that would keep anyone dancing and singing along. If it weren't for Gaye's skillful songcraft, his message might have been lost. Thankfully, 40 years later, this music lives on."

To get backstage, I told the security guard that I was Martin Luther King Jr.'s daughter, and it worked. I was immediately escorted to your dressing room. You greeted me graciously with a sisterly warmth â€” knowing full well, I'm sure, that I was an impostor. But you never let on. You maintained the stature and dignity befitting your justly earned title as the queen of soul."

He lashes out at Saturday Night Live for daring to mock him, with all of the megalomaniacal fury that makes mocking him so irresistible. Kanye has always balanced his cartoonish ego trips with an eagerness to bare his insecurities, though, and in \"Power\" he also owns up to struggling with self-doubt: \"reality is catching up with me/taking my inner child, Iâ€™m fighting for its custody.\" Now he just has to hope that fight is one his audience still cares to watch."

Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, who had collaborated with her on her genre-spanning 2004 smash \"Since U Been Gone,\" it didn't directly address her previous struggles. But it was pretty much an announcement that she was still able to embrace big, happy hooks -- and it vaulted from No. 97 to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 during its first two weeks on the chart. "

After all these years of hearing The Beatles' music, he's still discovering it, finding small phrases in the songs we know so well â€” \"Nowhere Man,\" \"In My Life\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever.\" And here comes the cliche, which is a living truth: Frisell makes these songs feel new again.

But if you'd closed your eyes, you wouldn't have known he was alone from the swarming textures that filled the room.

Indeed, the city has no shortage of natural showmen who enjoy playing ambassador; the Saturday lineup featured Soul Rebels Brass Band, Kermit Ruffins, Terence Blanchard and Ivan Neville's Dumpstaphunk. And New Orleans native Wendell Pierce, who plays trombonist Antoine Batiste on Treme, was the ideal emcee to exhort the Arena crowd of several thousand to its feet."

Allen grew up in the Detroit area, and she says she remembers artists who combined live jazz and dance when she was growing up. So she brought it back with this band. Timeline put out a live album last year, so the Monterey Jazz Festival not only invited her to play the Arena stage in 2011: It commissioned a new piece, a tribute to Sammy Davis, Jr. \"The Dazzler\" premiered on Saturday night to encouraging cheers, especially for hoofer Maurice Chestnut."

For some at the Coffee House Gallery â€” the most intimate room at Monterey â€” trumpeter Sarah Wilson was a positive new discovery. Her tunes seem to leave room for her band to be creative and maybe even a little messy, even when they're not soloing. She sings, too, with a curious voice â€” it's not at all typical of jazz singers. It's somewhat plain, and doesn't sound trained, which you can take or leave in itself. I liked that it gave her a singer-songwriter, almost country-rock dimension in her composing."

For his sextet's Monterey show, Santos invited Puerto Rican rapper Rico PabÃ?n to join in, reprising and expanding on his role on Santos' new FilosofÃ?a CaribeÃ±a, Vol. 1. PabÃ?n grew up in a family of salsa musicians, so he found his way in here with rhythmic understanding and aggression. Sometimes these hip-hop-meets-jazz things are in general less than inspiring, but when they get it right, it gives literal voice to the social commentary that's often embedded within instrumental jazz.

That humble comment aside, Kalhor is a great master who embodies the core principles of this style of music: the ability to perform, entirely by heart, a huge amount of music composed over centuries â€” but then to take that tradition to new places through the art of improvisation. For us, he then proceeded to spin out a soulful, contemplative and beautifully moving improvisation in the mode of Nava."

Young Leguizamo is simply bored out of his mind until he spots a  Latin singer onstage: \"And all of a sudden, I heard the name Morales onstage. And there was this Latin person there. And she ain't have a gun in her hand or a hypodermic needle. And she wasn't a hooker or a maid. Her last name was Maldonado. She looked Puerto Rican, but  she wasn't a hooker. So it was kinda hard to tell if she was Latin.\""

He makes a point of discussing the uncomfortable  fact that so many Hispanics in this country find themselves in the terrible  position of being rejected by mainstream American society, but also  discriminated against in their countries of ancestry. In his current  show, Ghetto Klown, his beloved grandfather finds out about his dream to  be an entertainer and advises him: \"Mijito, nenito, only white Latinos  make it to Telemundo, mijito. Stay out of the sun. Walk on the shaded  side of the street. Don't even eat dark food.\" In this week's show Leguizamo  shares his views on Latinos in the media today, both in Hollywood and in Spanish  language entertainment.

Como resultado Lila escuchaba mÃºsica muy variada: en la casa de su padre, amante del jazz, se escuchaba a Miles Davis. Y en el hogar de su madre, fanÃ¡tica de la musica ranchera, se oÃ?a a Lola BeltrÃ¡n y otros Ã?conos de la mÃºsica tradicional mexicana."
