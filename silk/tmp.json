But everything about his set at Stubb's on Wednesday night was a raving, raging bundle of surprises: Deacon puts on some of the most rivetingly unpredictable, oddly interactive concerts in the business, whether he's teaching the crowd how to move in choreographed unison â€” witness the dance contest that precedes \"Konono Ripoff No. 1\" â€” or issuing a long spoken riff that somehow invokes both Avatar and the mom from the movie Big.</p><p>Bookended by busy drummers and looming over an array of technology that looks as if it could power a small spacecraft â€” not to mention a large glowing skull, film projections and a prolific assortment of blinking lights â€” Deacon serves as ringleader for a ludicrously overdriven orgy of sound. Naturally, lots went wrong along the way, from technical difficulties and language malfunctions to hastily recruited dancers Deacon publicly derided as inadequate. But the calamities aren't so much incidental as integral to a live act that's all about barely contained chaos.</p><p>Credits</p><p>Producers: Amy Schriefer, Robin Hilton; Video by: XI Media; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]</p>"

It's short for \"Music and Gaming Festival,\" and it's designed to celebrate the music of video games.</p><p>As video-game technology keeps improving, the graphics become crisper, the action faster, and the sound quality richer. But for many gamers, the music from video games was best in the earlier days of low-tech 8-bit and 16-bit game systems.</p><p>Beyond The Limits Of Technology</p><p>In 1995, the fantasy time-travel adventure game Chrono Trigger was released to widespread critical acclaim. The music from the game was a big part of its success, even though it came from the simple sound chip of a Super Nintendo Entertainment System.</p><p>Armcannon, a progressive metal band that performs TV and video-game music covers, brings the music of those old games to life when it performs them live. Daniel Behrens, one of Armcannon's guitarists, says the musicians who perform at MAGFest have a high degree of skill, because it's a challenge to take a song that was designed to be computerized and arrange it into a version that mere humans can perform.</p><p>\"There are virtuoso people everywhere you look,\" Behrens says. \"And that is one of the things that really made me fall in love with MAGFest and the video-game music scene.\"</p><p>Behrens says classic game music is composed of catchy melodies, rather than the kind of atmospheric pieces one might hear in an orchestra.</p><p>Amanda Lepre, who plays guitar for the band Descendants of Erdrick, says those unique 8-bit tunes had melodies that are memorable years later. There's no better example than the theme from Super Mario Bros.</p><p>\"Just because it was in one of the most popular games of all time, that's not the only reason why people remember the song,\" Lepre says. \"It's a catchy song. It's got a good melody.\"</p><p>A Master Video-Game Composer</p><p>Many bands at MAGFest play video-game covers, but the group that generated the most excitement was Earthbound Papas, a band made up of video-game composers.</p><p>Hailing from Japan, the best-known member of the band is its leader and keyboardist, Nobuo Uematsu. He composed most of the soundtracks from the Final Fantasy series, one of the best-selling game franchises of all time. Like other musicians at MAGFest, Uematsu says a talent for melody is at the core of great video-game music.</p><p>\"It's pretty easy for me to come up with the melodies,\" Uematsu says. \"It's in my head all the time, and I struggle to pick which ones to use.\"</p><p>Even though his music has been performed in concert halls by orchestras around the world, Uematsu says he still loves to perform at rock festivals like MAGFest. He explains that video-game music fans have a special connection with one another.</p><p>\"Perhaps video games are minor things still,\" he says. \"Because of that, there's a strong bond within the community.\"</p><p>If attendance at MAGFest is any indication, that community is growing. Last year, more than 3,000 fans came to the festival. This year, attendance nearly doubled. [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]</p>"

                    "text"      : "<p>Boyz II Men members Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman and former member Michael McCary began cementing themselves in R&B history in 1991. Their single \"Motownphilly\" became a hit and was followed by a series of other chart-topping songs. The group has earned four Grammy awards, performed around the world and sold tens of millions of albums.</p><p>Their latest album, Twenty, features 10 new songs and 10 past hits. It marks their two decades of entertaining a generation of loyal fans.</p><p>They join Tell Me More guest host Tony Cox to reflect on their careers and sing a few songs.</p><p>\"We came up at a time where there was an R&B group pretty much on every street corner, and every record company had one,\" says Nathan Morris, \"but now, it's dwindled down to solo artists, or the duets, or even bigger bands â€” where you have bands like The Roots that got seven or eight people â€” but the actual R&B group is a dinosaur.\"</p><p>Wanya Morris says the genre grew beyond what people were typically tuning into. \"The R&B circuit still was there,\" he says. \"It just had very little validity in a time when people were saying, 'I'm into having sex; I'm not into making love,' where Boyz II Men, R&B singers â€” that's all we sing about. ... And we have to take a backseat until it's time for people to want to make love again.\"</p><p>Their hit \"I'll Make Love to You\" was on the 1994 album II. They say the best thing they did for that album was record it away from their Philadelphia home, in a place without distractions: a studio called Granny's House in Nevada.</p><p>Losing A Member </p><p>\"We kind of had our own personal meetings as a group to make sure that we all stayed focused on what the idea was. ... Unfortunately, throughout the project, we saw Mike [McCary] was slipping,\" says Nathan Morris. \"He wasn't really focusing on the things that needed to be done. He'd show up late; he missed a couple of events. ... We were kind of put in the spot where we either had to shut it down or go, so we just went out there and tried to do it ourselves as a threesome. ... Mentally, we said to ourselves, 'Let's just prepare, just in case he does not come back.' \"</p><p>McCary went on to pursue an individual career.</p><p>Growing From Boys To Men </p><p>Guest host Tony Cox points out that the group began singing as boys (in high school), but after 20 years, they have become men â€” so how about a name change, possibly \"Men to Better Men\"? With a laugh, Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris and Stockman unanimously reject the idea.</p><p>\"The name 'Boyz II Men' simply means growth,\" Wanya Morris says. \"We're always going to be striving to reach the perfection of being a man.  ... And hopefully, with the blessing of God, we can reach that one day. But now, at this point, we got a lot of wisdom and everything to gain in order to even consider ourselves to be full-faceted men without those boyish qualities that keep us who we are.\"</p><p>He adds that maybe the boy quality he cannot relinquish is spending long hours watching cartoons: \"I sit in a room all day, from probably the time I get there until the time I go to the show, to watch Cartoon Network in my undies, in my tank top. It's beautiful.\"</p><p>Nathan Morris says, \"One of the reasons why the name is so strong for us is that our music tends to bridge generation gaps. ... We sill have 9-year-olds coming to concerts, singing 'End of the Road,' and they were never even here.\" [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]</p>"

Click the link above to hear Gaye  biographer David Ritz evaluate the album and its legacy on Weekend Edition Saturday.</p><p>Marvin Gaye's What's Going On was an instant classic, as well as one of the most influential records from a passionate and enduring icon. Released on May 21, 1971, the album is an introspective, politically charged nine-piece song cycle that addresses the ravages of the Vietnam War, urban decay, drug abuse, civil unrest and injustice. Gaye was singing to his generation in an effort to wake people up to the struggles no one was willing to discuss at that time. But these songs are universal; they've transcended their time and place. Listen carefully and you'll notice how much they still resonate.</p><p>While What's Going On ranks among the best R&B records to so openly and artfully reflect such social consciousness, it was not the last of its kind. What's Going On has become a template for how to marry a strong message with a pop sensibility in order to reach as large an audience as possible. Gaye's songs are filled with sophisticated yet instantly recognizable hooks and languid, jazz-inflected funk grooves that would keep anyone dancing and singing along. If it weren't for Gaye's skillful songcraft, his message might have been lost. Thankfully, 40 years later, this music lives on.</p><p>In honor of the 40th anniversary of What's Going On, Motown is reissuing a new \"Super Deluxe Edition\" of the record, complete with unreleased tracks and rarities. Most of these songs will be immediately familiar, so NPR Music has assembled a panel of Marvin Gaye fans to reflect on the album and its legacy. [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]</p>"

                    "text"      : "<p>Whirring sounds of an old Heidelberg Windmill letterpress echo in the warehouse of Globe Poster in East Baltimore. Owner Bob Cicero explains how the machine works.</p><p>\"The suckers on the top actually suck the paper, creating a vacuum, and then actually lifts the papers up, puts it in these grippers,\" he says. \"These grippers will come around, and if you take a look, you have what you're going to print right here...\"</p><p>The machine is out of date, but it's just one item in the giant warehouse testifying to Globe's 80 years in business.</p><p>\"And then all you do, it comes in and now I put the impression on by moving this bar out,\" Cicero continues. \"And now, she'll print.\"</p><p>Cicero is printing with a block of type that reads \"Special Ladies Dance.\"  He's a master printer who knows his trade, and he should â€” he's worked for Globe Poster since 1965. Cicero is the youngest of three brothers who own the company now. His father, Joseph, Sr., bought it in the mid-'70s after working there for 40 years.</p><p>The History</p><p>The company was launched over a card game in Philadelphia in 1929.  Founder Harry Shapiro decided where to place the company by folding a map of the United States and discovering Baltimore was the midpoint on the East Coast.  Globe's early work consisted largely of film posters.  It would receive artwork from the film, then imprint necessary information â€” date, venue, time â€” to finish the job.</p><p>\"And that's how we really got our beginnings, from doing imprints and carnival posters,\" says Bob Cicero. \"It's a poor man's advertising, especially during the depression. That's when we started. It's a really great way to advertise and it's economical.\"</p><p>Huge stacks of posters sit on the warehouse floor and on shelves, blocks of wood type lie scattered, and zinc printing plates spill out of larger-than-life-sized bins â€” each imprinted with the face of just about any musician you can think of.</p><p>Local antique store owner Christian Sturgis is also at Globe Poster's warehouse.  He's a member of \"Friends of Globe\" â€” a grassroots coalition of local citizens and students who have been raising money for the company to pay its rent and other financial necessities until its collections are purchased.  Sturgis has been selling original posters and publicity stills in his shop and online.  Some go for thousands.  He sorts through a box of metal plates.</p><p>\"There's approximately 10,000,\" says Sturgis. \"An artist would send the photograph to Globe and they would make a zinc plate for printing.\"</p><p>An artist paid 40 dollars to have a plate made from his image on a publicity photograph.  That image could then be used for future show posters at no extra charge.  The deal benefited the artists â€” they got more bang for their buck â€” as well as the company, who were essentially guaranteed future business.</p><p>The Music</p><p>Etta James, Chuck Berry, B.B. King, Solomon Burke...the list of artists whose images and shows have appeared on Globe Posters is incalculable.  Baltimore Magazine Arts and Culture editor John Lewis has written articles about Globe and is working on a film called Say It Loud: The Globe Poster Documentary.</p><p>\"When you look at Globe's work over the years, you can really see that they have documented the history of American music,\" says Lewis, \"in particular the development of African-American music.\"</p><p>From early big-band jazz artists like Dizzy Gillespie, to rock 'n' roll, soul and funk, Globe Poster was the go-to place for concert advertising.</p><p>\"They used to do these 'Biggest Show of Stars!' posters, in the '50s into the '60s. And they would be these sort of multi-act rhythm and blues reviews, you know, and with some rock acts, too. But it would be, you know, LaVern Baker, Clyde McPhatter, Chuck Berry,\" says Lewis. \"And then they did these great posters, too, for Otis Redding at the Apollo, James Brown at the Apollo, and again, these are just classics. I mean, from James Brown, from early on in his career with the Famous Flames, right in through to the '60s, the '70s.\"</p><p>And for showgoers, a Globe Poster signified that an event was really happening.</p><p>\"They might hear that, hey, Solomon Burke is going to perform in Fayetteville. And over the years, they were really conditioned to the fact that until they saw the Globe Poster, the show wasn't official,\" says Lewis.  \"[The posters] were just designed so beautifully. I don't know how you could resist going to the show once you saw the poster!\"</p><p>Design</p><p>In the mid-'50s, a Globe employee named Harry Knorr heard about Day-Glo ink â€” fluorescent pigments made from fish scales.  The ink was cheaper and easier to print, and more noticeable at night or from a car.  Globe Poster started using it on its posters.</p><p>\"They had the fluorescent oranges, the pinks, the yellows, the greens,\" says Bob Cicero, \"and if you take a look at the outside world, everything is browns, blacks and whites. Well, this hit you in the face and you looked at it. You would actually see it. It was just advertising at its best.\"</p><p>Besides being a useful advertising tool, Day-Glo ink gave Globe what's now known as its iconic style.  There was some method to how the ink was applied.</p><p>\"But by taking the fluorescent colors and actually putting [them] behind the person's name, it made that person really stand out,\" explains Cicero. \"Whether he was important or not, he looks important. And even when you have five to eight acts, we still did the same thing.\"</p><p>The artists liked having their names in bold black type, highlighted by the neon shades of Day-Glo.</p><p>\"Solomon Burke told me, he said, Globe Poster was our Internet,\" says journalist John Lewis. \"We didn't have money to be on the radio. We weren't invited to be on television at that point in our careers. Globe Poster got our names out there, advertised our shows.\"</p><p>Globe Poster Today</p><p>Globe Poster continued its success through the funk and Go-Go music eras, to hip hop, and even with more recent artists like Beck and Rage Against the Machine.  In the '90s, Globe posters began getting recognition as pieces of artwork with their unique aesthetic, which came as a surprise to Bob Cicero.</p><p>\"We just knew what we liked and how we liked it. And we stuck with it regardless if somebody didn't like it or not. You know, I always called our posters a working poster,\" says Cicero. \"They were not meant to hang on the wall in those days and go, 'Oh my god, this is beautiful art.' But if it was in your face and you can see it and read it, that's what we cared about.\"</p><p>Baltimore Magazine's John Lewis agrees.</p><p>\"It was this utilitarian piece of advertising and that's how they viewed it. The guys working on those posters were hand-routing the wood blocks they would use to lock up in the letterpress forms,\" says Lewis. \"I mean, they were working-class guys from East Baltimore, South Baltimore, it was a blue-collar job. It wasn't art.\"</p><p>In recent years, the introduction of modern printing techniques began to put a damper on the business of the industrial print shop.  Plus, a series of incidents â€” health issues in the Cicero family, \"post-no-bills\" regulations in cities, and a bad business deal â€” hit the company hard.  After Globe closed its doors last year, several voices in the community stepped up.</p><p>Friends of Globe and MICA</p><p>\"It just became overwhelming...the monetary wealth but also the historical importance of this company was laying out and not really having a ship to really sail on,\" says Christian Sturgis, who heard about Globe Poster through a friend.</p><p>\"It's a treasure trove â€” it's unbelievable,\" says Mary Mashburn. \"The first time you see it, you just can't really take it all in.\"</p><p>Mashburn  runs a small printing company called Typecast Press, and teaches  printing classes at Maryland Institute College of Art â€” or MICA â€” in  Baltimore. She's also  a member of Friends of Globe. She says most letterpress shops today are  small boutique operations, printing invitations, stationary, and the  like. But young people, her students at MICA among them, have taken an  interest in the method.</p><p>\"To  them it feels very, very old and removed as an industrial printing  method, but it feels very fresh and exciting to translate from their  all-digital world to  something that has a real hand-craft to it,\" says Mashburn.</p><p>Mashburn  had the idea that maybe MICA would be interested in purchasing Globe's  massive printing collection for its students.  She teamed  up with Gail Deery, chair of the printmaking department at MICA, to  move the idea forward.</p><p>Students  liked the idea as well. Senior graphic design majors Allison Fisher, Carolyn Williams and Sabrina  Kogan put together a Friends of Globe group at MICA.</p><p>\"I  think all of us have been bitten by the Day-Glo bug,\" says Kogan. Fisher agrees: \"I bought new sneakers and I was in the store  looking at colors, and  I was like, I'll just get the black and lime green!\"</p><p>They started a Facebook group and a blog,  and printed their own Globe-style posters. They also collected student statements to present to MICA's administration.</p><p>\"The Cicero Brothers wanted it to stay in Baltimore â€” it's so ingrained in Baltimore's history,\" says Carolyn Williams. \"And MICA is so ingrained in Baltimore's history that it seemed the perfect opportunity for the collection to come to MICA and for it to be used again.\"</p><p>In March, MICA announced it was purchasing roughly 75 percent of Globe Poster's printing materials. Ellen Lupton, Director of the Graphic Design MFA program at MICA, describes what they'll be used for.</p><p>\"It's not a museum archive,\" says Lupton. \"It's a working collection of typefaces and engraved illustrations and original woodcuts that our students and faculty and ultimately, we hope, the public will be able to create new things with.\"</p><p>To prepare for the purchase, Fisher, Williams and Kogan have been sorting blocks of wood type and other materials at Globe's warehouse.  They've received very positive feedback on their efforts.</p><p>\"We've had presses all over the country say, I want to be a Friend of Globe, add me to your blog list,\" says Fisher. \"So just seeing that...people care and people are excited this is happening and the collection is staying together is just really, really awesome.\"</p><p>Bob Cicero is still searching for a buyer for a large portion of Globe's music-related assets.  But he's thrilled about the MICA deal.</p><p>\"I'd love to see what happens in the next two to three years and what they do,\" says Cicero. \"And I'm pretty sure â€” not pretty sure, I'm positive â€” that it's going to be awesome.\"</p><p>Cicero will have a chance to see what the students do with the tools he's used for so long: He'll be teaching a graduate letterpress class at MICA in the fall.</p><p>\"He has had such a huge part of designing these all of these amazing posters that we look at and that we study and that we collect,\" says Sabrina Kogan. \"And being able to give back to him in a way and say, we appreciate what you've done and we're going to continue, is really exciting.\" [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]</p>"

Late on Saturday night, Bob Boilen walked out of a frustrating set by SBTRKT that was filled with grumpy fans, thinking that his time in Austin was about to end on a down note.</p><p>\"I walked down the street and there's this Qawwali band playing with 12 musicians, just right down by the Driskill [Hotel],\" Bob said. \"And there were people dancing, people in Irish hats clapping along and dancing, a man running as fast as he could, he said, 'This is my music!' And then it's over and I walk 12 feet and there's this band from Colombia playing with these beautiful dancers in these white dresses.\"</p><p>SXSW can be overwhelming, but it's never too late for a pleasant surprise or two. The final night before NPR Music's team would depart from Austin offered surprises in many shapes. (You can find all our coverage, including concerts, blog posts and more, at our main SXSW page.)</p><p>In East Austin, Ann Powers saw Bay Area-based cocaine rap purveyors The Jacka and Husalah sneak both Black Sabbath's \"Iron Man\" and a bit of mariachi into a set she called \"heartwarming.\" And she closed out her night by seeing \"one of those collaborations that SXSW is  famous for: GZA, the rapper from the Wu-Tang Clan, with Grupo Fantasma,  the Latin funk band based here in Austin. Really high-energy. It was  amazing how that band turned their Latin sound into hip-hop beats.\"</p><p>Bob caught a set by New Orleans Sissy Bounce artist Vockah Redu: \"It was really amazing, and you can see emotionally how it really hits people. It's very powerful.\"</p><p>undefined</p><p>Not everything great was a surprise.</p><p>Said Stephen Thompson: \"I saw some folk artists perform at St. David's Cathedral. They had guitars and they sang like angels.\"</p><p>Those angelic folk singers go by the name The Milk Carton Kids. \"Two boys singing in Simon & Garfunkel-esque harmonies with acoustic guitars. It sounds on paper [like] the most Thompsonian nonsense, just angelic folk pop,\" Stephen said. But, \"They have a song called 'Charlie,' and Robin, it would have killed you dead if you had heard it. It was a song for the daughter that he hopes to one day have, and as the father of a daughter, it's just exactly what you would hope someone to say. ... It was just beautiful.\"</p><p>Two more highlights from St. David's: the rock band Firehorse, led by Leah Siegel, and the prolific-but-underappreciated singer/songwriter Micah P. Hinson, who has, in Stephen's words, a \"thousand-year-old voice.\"</p><p>Robin Hilton missed Hinson, but caught a couple of hard rock acts with NPR Music producer and photographer Mike Katzif. The first, Psychedelic Horses---, were \"Three entirely indifferent stoner dudes who were just like, 'Whatever, errrrghghhh,\" Robin says. \"It was kind of a sloppy mess of a performance, but it was fun.\"</p><p>After that set, a crowd gathered to see the hard rock band Ceremony turned into a mosh pit that separated Robin from Mike, who was getting \"boinked\" on the head while trying to photograph the band. \"It was kind of a horrifying punk-metal experience.\"</p><p>But Robin called the British pop-rock group Slow Club his highlight of the day. \"I had never heard of them, but I ran into Alisa Ali of WFUV and she took me to the show,\" he said. \"I was in love immediately.\"</p><p>Bob wasn't entirely sold on blue-eyed soul singer Allen Stone: \"He's a super-talented fellow with an incredible band, [but it's] not my music.\" There was something notable about the show, though. \"Ann, he has your hair and my hat.\"</p><p>Saturday gave Ann her favorite set of the entire week (including the two-and-a-half hour Springsteen concert): the Queens rapper Nas performing his classic album Illmatic in its entirety. That's a trend many older artists have embraced, but Nas took the performance to a new level.</p><p>\"He had this complete set that was Queensbridge projects, [with a] big sign and buildings that looked like New York City and video that was just crazy and he was almost acting out the complete album,\" Ann said. \"He had DJ Premier and Pete Rock and the other rapper, AZ, who appears on the album. And obviously, it was one of those sets where the audience knew every word, but I was thinking, 'This thing could go to Broadway!' It was a theater piece! 'Nas On Broadway!' That's my new cry.\"</p><p>What act would the guys anoint as their favorite?</p><p>Bob broke his rule about only watching performers he'd never seen before a few times, and it paid off in his favorite set of the week: Patrick Watson, \"hands down.\"</p><p>\"There were some bigger surprises, but I'd agree,\" Robin said. \"Patrick Watson was the most moving that I'll be thinking about for a long time.\"</p><p>Stephen tried to get away with naming a half-dozen bands, at first. \"I cried at three different things!\" Bob pressed him to pick one. \"I'm gonna go with Kishi Bashi, and kind of as a representative of  somebody who did not get approved to play the festival and yet there were still these miraculous performances. It's just a sign that as incredibly all-encompassing and enveloping as this experience is over the course of four days, there are still so many discoveries beyond it,\" he said. \"It's such an incredibly invigorating experience. We're here at the end of night five, and as much as I'm not sure any of us want to see a show tomorrow night, I always come out of it feeling full of excitement about music.\"</p><p>We can't wait until next year.

Tell us in the comments.</p><p>Kanye West's \"Power\" is the rapper/producer's first solo release since his infamous run-in with Taylor Swift at MTV's Video Music Awards, which instantly transformed him from \"the artist we love to hate\" into simply \"that guy everybody hates.\" But anyone expecting humble apologies is in for a surprise, as this comeback offers more defiance than contrition.</p><p>undefined</p><p>Over a bombastic sample -- taken from \"21st Century Schizoid Man,\" by '70s progressive-rock icons King Crimson -- Mr. West proclaims of himself \"no one man should have that much power,\" in a chorus derived from Spike Lee's Malcolm X biopic. He lashes out at Saturday Night Live for daring to mock him, with all of the megalomaniacal fury that makes mocking him so irresistible. Kanye has always balanced his cartoonish ego trips with an eagerness to bare his insecurities, though, and in \"Power\" he also owns up to struggling with self-doubt: \"reality is catching up with me/taking my inner child, Iâ€™m fighting for its custody.\" Now he just has to hope that fight is one his audience still cares to watch.</p><p>The idea of the \"comeback\" song is not one that's entirely new to pop, although the timeframe between exit and comeback has become somewhat compressed in the 140-character age. (Elapsed time between the Video Music Awards run-in and the day \"Power\" first leaked online: eight months, 15 days.) And comeback singles aren't always successes; the road back from pop oblivion is littered with the likes of the Spice Girls' \"Headlines\" and MC Hammer's \"Pumps And A Bump.\" Two recent examples of comeback singles show two different approaches.</p><p>Rihanna's \"Russian Roulette\" was the first single from her 2009 album Rated-R, and it dealt head-on with her time spent away from the spotlight. The song, co-written by her frequent collaborator Ne-Yo, is a lament about the consequences that rise out of the game of love -- although its violent imagery caused many to think of her domestic-violence incident with Chris Brown, which occurred just a few months prior. Its video debuted on 20/20 in November, strengthening the song's ties to the narrative that she had become older, wiser, and sadder about matters of the heart as a result of the incident in February.</p><p>Kelly Clarkson's \"My Life Would Suck Without You,\" which led off the push for her 2009 album All I Ever Wanted, represented her re-embracing of pop after her \"difficult\" third album My December, which was marked by label-politics-related struggles she had with Sony Music head Clive Davis, thanks to her insistence on penning a lot of the album's tracks herself. Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, who had collaborated with her on her genre-spanning 2004 smash \"Since U Been Gone,\" it didn't directly address her previous struggles. But it was pretty much an announcement that she was still able to embrace big, happy hooks -- and it vaulted from No. 97 to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 during its first two weeks on the chart. </p><p>Pop Off is a conversation between music writer Maura Johnston and Jay Smooth (of Illdoctrine.com) about pop music that occasionally airs on Morning Edition.

Now, two new records showcase contrasting approaches that can be spun out of old-time religious tunes.</p><p>Charles Mingus' approach to gospel has inspired generations of jazz musicians, including Don Byron. Byron and his New Gospel Quintet chase gospel's extroverted side, those toe-tapping jubilee-style rave-ups, on Love, Peace, and Soul. Many of their arrangements open with a vocal chorus, followed by solo turns that travel far from what's printed in the hymnbook. Pianist Xavier Davis nudges gospel's simple harmonies into a modern jazz context.</p><p>The solos on Byron's new work are certainly high spirited â€” almost Saturday-night boisterous. Sometimes, though, we turn to gospel for calm reflection, and this is where Hank Jones and Charlie Haden shine.</p><p>The second gospel collaboration between Jones and Haden, Come Sunday, was recorded a few months before Jones died in 2010. It is transfixingly effortless music â€” a conversation between masters, built around these solid, reassuring melodies they've heard (and likely played) for decades.</p><p>Sometimes jazz improvisation has a muscle-flexing, look-what-I-can do aspect. Not this music. Jones and Haden are long past the point of trying to impress anybody. As they shut out the chatter of the modern world, the two go searching for a higher truth, a moment's peace. In these sturdy old songs of faith, they find it.</p><p>  [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]</p>"

Now that he's an internationally  acclaimed saxophonist who tours the world's best jazz clubs and  festivals, he freely admits that he had a thing for smooth jazz growing  up in Colorado in the '80s. \"Besides Charlie Parker,\" he writes in the  liner notes to his latest album, \"the first sounds that inspired me to  play the saxophone as a child were soul/R&B and jazz 'fusion'  artists such as Grover Washington Jr., David Sanborn, the Brecker  Brothers and The Yellowjackets.\"</p><p>That latest album, 2011's Samdhi,  borrows a bit from that past and its electric funk excesses. It also  integrates ideas from South Indian scales and modes, hip-hop  and computer music programming. Atop all that, Mahanthappa is an  astonishing soloist, a swarm of locusts rampaging through an irregular  beat. It's an impressive listen which becomes a bug-eyed, mouth-agape  experience when you see it live.</p><p>When Mahanthappa recently toured the Samdhi songbook  in Washington, D.C., we had him stop by the NPR Music offices to give  us a taste â€” and he brought along some old friends. Drummer Rudy Royston and  Mahanthappa played in a Denver-based band together some 20-odd years  ago, and have since reconnected in New York; electric bassist Rich Brown  has played in just about every conceivable setting from his home base  of Toronto, including the Canadian Indo-jazz group Autorickshaw;  guitarist Rez Abbasi is a long-time confrere in the dual worlds of jazz  and South Asian music.</p><p>When Rudresh, Rez, Rich and Rudy tore into  the frantic \"Killer,\" everyone  immediately perked up.

Already, a crowd here at NPR was buzzing around, waiting to hear Frisell make his magic and watching him set up an array of pedals. I've never seen anyone play guitar the way Frisell plays: What I hear is a man on a mission of discovery, where one chord, one note, one effect can send him in unplanned, uncharted directions.</p><p>My palms felt sweaty the first time I saw him play. I know the stomp boxes he uses to make his loops â€” one of which is an Electro-Harmonix 16-second delay, a pedal I used to use in live performance in the 1980s. I know how fragile and sometimes unpredictable it can be, but it's the backbone of Frisell's bag of many tricks. With that equipment enhancing Frisell's nimble, deft fingerwork and uncanny sense of melody, it all adds up to a brilliant and disarmingly humble performer.</p><p>On this day, Frisell came to perform the music of John Lennon. Now 60, Frisell witnessed the birth of The Beatles and all that it meant to moving the world from cute, catchy songs to sonic adventures â€” a world of music we don't think twice about anymore. After all these years of hearing The Beatles' music, he's still discovering it, finding small phrases in the songs we know so well â€” \"Nowhere Man,\" \"In My Life\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever.\" And here comes the cliche, which is a living truth: Frisell makes these songs feel new again.

As spring renews the earth, people celebrate this fresh beginning as Nowruz, a joyous 12-day festival to celebrate beauty and abundance. We were lucky enough to have a master musician and composer from Iran, Kayhan Kalhor, visit us in time to celebrate with his gorgeous and deeply moving music.</p><p>As one of our interns observed during Kalhor's mic check, Kalhor's instrument does the dancing as he kneels with his legs folded beneath him. (This performance actually marks a Tiny Desk Concert first: having a musician perform on top of Bob Boilen's desk, covered for the occasion by a rug, as Persian tradition dictates.) As Kalhor plays, his bowed, four-stringed kamencheh, a spiked fiddle, spins this way and that, swaying gracefully from side to side.</p><p>Before Kalhor played for us, I asked him what he was going to perform. He told me that it was to be an improvisation: \"I don't know yet where I'll start, or where I'll end up,\" Kalhor said simply. That humble comment aside, Kalhor is a great master who embodies the core principles of this style of music: the ability to perform, entirely by heart, a huge amount of music composed over centuries â€” but then to take that tradition to new places through the art of improvisation. For us, he then proceeded to spin out a soulful, contemplative and beautifully moving improvisation in the mode of Nava.</p><p>Perhaps, as both spring and the Persian new year begin, improvisation isn't a bad metaphor for the rest of us. Although you have an idea where you're headed when you start something, only in retrospect can you can fully know the ground on which you began â€” and, as you make your way along new terrain, you strive to create as much beauty and meaning as you can.</p><p>Set List:</p><p>undefined</p><p>\"Improvisation In Dastgah Nava\"</p><p>undefined</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Producer: Anastasia Tsioulcas; Editor: Doriane Raiman; Videographers: Michael Katzif and Doriane Raiman; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; photo by Doriane Raiman/NPR [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]</p>"

The 40-day celebration is dotted with makeshift stages all around the capital city of Montevideo for performances of choral music called murga. Murga is both entertainment and a sociopolitical commentary that survived the military dictatorship of the 1970s.</p><p>Murga songs like \"Los Curtidores de Hongos,\" which tells the story of the oldest murga choir in Uruguay, feature a guttural, forceful tone of singing that has been with the style from the beginning. Eduardo Rabelino, director of the Museum of Carnaval in Montevideo, says murga began in the working class. Street salesmen would sing in the same tone that they'd shout out on the streets.</p><p>Some were born of labor unions, Rabelino says. Six or seven street musicians who'd get together to have a good time and sing about what was happening in society. The tradition came to Uruguay via CadÃ?z, Spain, more than 100 years ago, where there is a similar choral music called chirigota. Today, a murga choir is made up of 13 voices singing complex harmonies, accompanied by three percussionists plus a choral director.</p><p>undefined</p><p>The performers wear elaborate, circus-like costumes and makeup, and compete every Carnaval. Now some choirs even have sponsors and CDs. But they still parody the talk of the town that year â€” be it corrupt politicians, a spike in violence or that annoying recording you get when you call for a taxi.</p><p>Daniel Angel Carluccio, the director of Los Curtidores de Hongos, says the riskiest time for murga was during Uruguay's military dictatorship of the '70s and early '80s. Carluccio had just joined a group then. He says when choirs wanted to criticize the government they had to use metaphors to avoid being censored. Murga choirs formed a bond with the public during that time.</p><p>At today's Carnavals, you can see that bond at the tablados, the makeshift stages that are set up all over Montevideo.</p><p>Agarrate Catalina is one of the younger murga choirs and last year's competition winner. The name is a popular saying that basically means \"Watch out, something's about to happen.\" In just one song, the choir goes from making fun of hippie culture to criticizing the former president.</p><p>\"Murga attacks everything,\" says YamandÃº Cardozo, the director of Agarrate Catalina.</p><p>Dozens of young murga choirs have formed since the '90s. Groups enunciate better now. There are female singers and different instruments. But Cardozo says it's important to preserve certain elements of how murga has always been.</p><p>Of the people who sing murga, Cardozo says the majority of them make a living doing something else â€” they work in a factory or an office. They are artists for a month and a half, and then go back to their daily lives. So, he says, that's why murga doesn't represent the masses; they are the masses.</p><p>When it's time for the music to begin, says Cardozo, it's just 13 guys singing their hearts out in front of their people.

He said it was barely present in his station's  format a few decades ago, but that today, it's roughly 70 percent of what he plays.</p><p>Bachata is that sweet, syncopated,  lovesick music full of guitar plucks, bongos and gÃ?iras that  you hear blasting from cars and Latin clubs today. But as recently as the late  1980s, it was frowned upon in its native Dominican Republic for being rustic  and vulgar. But it grew anyway, and was championed by Dominican artists  like Anthony Santos (one of the first bachateros to go mainstream) and Juan Luis  Guerra.</p><p>By the early 2000s, a shiny, perfectly produced Dominican-American  group with boy-next-door good looks (if you happen to have very good-looking  Caribbean neighbors) named Aventura got its big break with a sound that fused  bachata, hip-hop and R&B. Fronted by the charismatic Romeo Santos, the group's members were romantic but also bad boys, as heartbroken as they were heartbreakers, and  the public lapped it up.</p><p>Bachata has come a long way, and a  lot of it sounds different than it did in the dark days when  it was banned from high-society Dominican venues. As someone who  became musically conscious when the genre was already exploding, I found that hard to  believe, because it's simply beautiful music, lyrically and  sonically. I also love bachata because its mix of repression and  ultimate success feels like a symbol of Latin-American identity struggles.</p><p>Joan Soriano is a reminder of that. \"El Duque De La Bachata\" (\"The Duke Of Bachata\") is an example of the earthy,  unpretentious, undiluted bachata that was forced into a corner so long ago in  favor of more \"sophisticated\" sounds. Whether he's talking about having his  heart broken or about falling out of love, Soriano sounds honest and to the point,  and so do his guitar licks. The seventh of 15 kids and an exceptionally  talented musician whose music moved him from the countryside to Santo Domingo at 13,  Soriano is an essential piece of bachata's story.</p><p>Today, we consume pretty-boy bachata: It's polished, calculated and, by mainstream standards, photogenic. But when you hear Soriano's raw interpretation of bachata, you can't  help but wonder how such a beautiful sound was kept quiet for so long,  and marvel at its resilience.</p><p>La Familia Soriano is Joan Soriano's upcoming album, which in addition to new material, will feature the song \"CuÃ¡nto LlorÃ©.\"</p><p>Set List:</p><p>undefined</p><p>\"Me DecidÃ?

No way.</p><p>\"I don't know what I'd do with myself,\" Jones tells All Things Considered host Melissa Block. \"We don't wanna lay down and give up just 'cause we're old. Young people think we're crazy. Oh, one morning you'llÂ wake up and look in the mirror like I did and say, 'What the devil happened? Whoo! Where did it go, oh, Lordy!' \"</p><p>Jones was the youngest of eight kids, born during the Depression in a log house in the BigÂ Thicket, East Texas.Â His family didn't have electricity, but they did have a battery-powered radio. If you want to figure out where George Jones' voice comes from, he'll tell you -- it all started there, drifting in over the static.</p><p>\"The only music we ever listened to out in the piney woods was Roy Acuff and the Grand Ole Opry,\" Jones says. \"That was the only night of the week I was allowed to lay in the middle of the bed with Mama and Daddy, just long enough to hear Roy Acuff sing; then I had to go back to bed.\"</p><p>In 1954, Jones was 22 when he got his first record deal with Starday Records in Beaumont, Texas. His producer was Pappy Daily.</p><p>\"Finally, Pappy Daily came in there and said, 'George, I've heard you sing like Roy Acuff, Hank Williams, Lefty Frizzell. I just want to know one thing: Can you sing like George Jones?' I said, 'I thought you wanted to sell some records,' \" Jones says, laughing.</p><p>Whatever it is -- the alchemy of Roy, Hank and Lefty, mixed with his own wrenching ache -- Jones can pull and bend notes till they make you hurt.</p><p>Pure Emotion</p><p>That voice has turned on a new generation of country singers, including country star Dierks Bentley, who says he is proud to call Jones a friend. He even hangs a George Jones bottle opener on the keys to his truck.Â And what he hears in these songs is pure emotion.</p><p>\"He digs into every lyric, every word and milks every emotion out of that word or syllable,\" Bentley says. \"It's really unique. It's definitely his own style -- no one else can copy it.\"</p><p>\"Do you have a favorite George Jones song?\" Block asks.</p><p>\" 'Walk Through This World With Me' is probably my favorite love song,\" Bentley says. \"It's so sparse musically, and it leaves this huge space for his voice to really spread out in.\"</p><p>Sometimes people say it sounds like Jones sings through clenched teeth. Bentley says it's like Jones is \"holding that pain back.\" Either way, Jones sings what he knows: decades of hard drinking, drug addiction, violent rages, bankruptcy, failed rehab and failed marriages (most famously with his singing partner, Tammy Wynette) all filter into his songs.</p><p>\"I'm crazy over a ballad -- one that's got a story, that's different from something you've heard before,\" Jones says.</p><p>A Signature Song</p><p>That brings us to \"He Stopped Loving Her Today,\" a song about unrequitedÂ love that is taken to the grave: \"He said I'll love you till I die / She told him you'll forget in time / As the years went slowly by / She still preyed upon his mind.\"</p><p>After Jones finished recording this song, he told producer Billy Sherrill it was too morbid.</p><p>\"I said, 'Billy, I love the song,' but I said, 'It ain't gonna sell. It's too sad,' \" Jones says. \"But anyhow, how wrong could one person be? That turned out to be the signature song of my whole, entire career.\"</p><p>Jones has made a career out of heartbreak and pain, but he says it's not who he is as a person.</p><p>\"It's not that you're unhappy when you're doing ballads,\" Jones says. \"It's just that I try to live the song. During that three minutes or whatever it is, you try to step in that person's shoes. It seems for some reason the words tell you right away that you know how they feel.\" [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]</p>"

                    "text"      : "<p>Like countless performers before him, Marty Stuart portrays himself as hunted, haunted, misunderstood -- a rebel on the lam. It's a familiar story, whether it's coming from the blues, honky-tonk or hip-hop. The trick is to make that story sound fresh. Stuart does in the ringing guitars and high-lonesome holler of a song on his new album, Ghost Train, called \"Branded.\" Whether he intends it or not, \"Branded\" is also something of a pun: This new collection is Stuart's proclamation that, while he can't help but become a consumer brand, his branding is that of the outsider. All of this would be hopelessly hokey if the music didn't bolster his line of patter.</p><p>In \"Drifting Apart,\" Marty Stuart howls about a broken marriage in what amounts to an homage to the kind of steel-guitar super-hits George Jones and Buck Owens made decades ago. Stuart wrote the song and produced it himself. The steel guitar is played by Ralph Mooney, the man credited with nothing less than inventing the so-called \"Bakersfield Sound\" on hits with Buck Owens and Wynn Stewart, among many others. Stuart is a fluid guitar player himself, who played bluegrass mandolin behind Lester Flatt when Stuart was 13. But he never gets bogged down in fussy arrangements or mere nostalgia. </p><p>Stuart's duet partner in the vibrant new song \"I Run to You\" is his wife, Connie Smith, a great country singer, starting with her indelible 1964 hit \"Once a Day.\" Sometimes it seems as though Marty Stuart has built a life around him that allows him to live in a kind of perpetual country-music time-machine. He curates exhibits of music memorabilia and photography, and does restoration work on legends such as Porter Wagoner, for whom Stuart produced a lively 2007 album, shortly before Wagoner's death at age 80. Stuart has a song on Ghost Train called \"Porter Wagoner's Grave\" that's at once eloquent and maudlin in a long tradition of country death songs. </p><p>All is not gloom and grave-dust, however, as \"Little Heartbreaker\" demonstrates. The longer you ride in Marty Stuart's Ghost Train, the more its speed and energy hits you like the wind in your face. In the liner notes to this new album, Marty Stuart says that he felt it was time to \"write some songs and play some hard-hitting country music.\" Most of the time, Ghost Train hits hard, dead center in the sweet spot between old and new, until you can't tell the difference.

                    "text"      : "<p>Within seven months of arriving in Nashville from his native Wisconsin, singer-songwriter Josh Thompson had his first hit song and a music-publishing deal. Now he's released his first album, Way Out Here, in which he comes on like an old pro at making country-music albums. That is, he makes them the way they used to, when albums arrived on vinyl, five songs to a side. </p><p>Most stars think that putting less than 15 tracks on a collection is cheating, while they make most of their cash on hit-single downloads. But Josh Thompson has sussed out his key demo. He knows the country-music audience still buys albums, and probably won't squawk about the number of songs as long as the quality is consistent.</p><p>\"Won't Be Lonely Long\" is a first-rate song that's addictively clever; it fakes you out in the beginning by making you think it's going to be a tears-in-my-beer ballad, then kicks into an upbeat honky-tonk tune. The first, weepy verse is perfect mood music, and the raucous stuff is superb fun. Positioned as the fourth song on the album â€” after songs that make nods to Waylon Jennings and how all he needs is \"a couple bucks when I'm itchin' for a scratch-off ticket\" â€” Thompson is pulling off something impressive here.  He's acknowledging his betters and boasting about how far he's already come, without coming off like an arrogant jerk.</p><p>Thompson possesses a strong, surging, but not particularly distinctive voice. It's the voice of a songwriter, which is how Thompson got his foot in the Nashville music industry door. He wrote a popular song for someone else â€” Jason Michael Carroll â€” called \"Growing Up Is Getting Old,\" which proved Thompson's gift for melodic hooks and the sort of tight little puns that are the stuff of country-music mini-manifestoes. </p><p>Thompson's own album is stuffed with good examples of this-is-what-I-stand-for statements â€” most blazingly on the title song, \"Way Out Here,\" where puns do the work of truth-telling. The title refers to the backwoods life the narrator describes with lovingly surly detail. But the phrase also means that this is the way we live out here, with \"guns and the good Lord\" invoked as warnings, and the invocation of three Johns â€” John Wayne, Johnny Cash and John Deere â€” to prove his working-class roots. </p><p>Thompson makes a point in interviews to mention his time spent pouring concrete for driveways and basements in his father's Milwaukee concrete business.  Much like the hip-hop industry, authenticity â€” feigned or real â€” is important to impress upon the fans. To Thompson's credit, he doesn't brag about it excessively, and often uses it for some fun â€” as when he says in \"You Ain't Seen Country Yet\": \"If you ain't made love to a Merle Haggard cassette, you ain't seen country yet.\"</p><p>For a first-time album, Way Out Here is impressive not just for the confidence of Thompson's delivery, but also for its consistency. One of the business models of earlier-era country music Thompson doesn't follow is the old formula of front-loading your album with two or three hit singles, and padding the rest with filler. On Way Out Here, Thompson makes every cut count.  [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]</p>"

But if you look at the cultural game changers, it's precisely the people who ignore those rules who make a mark. Among the artists we love most here on Alt.Latino, there's little room for purists. We celebrate people who laugh at the established norms and take seemingly clashing genres and fuse them together into something completely new and exciting.</p><p>If you checked out my own personal music collection, you might be surprised. Latin alternative is only a part of the music that fills my iPod. It's also loaded with salsa, reggaeton, cumbia, American rap, pop and '60s R&B. Some are genres we rarely get to talk about on the show, but they have all informed the music we play on Alt.Latino.</p><p>This week we're doing something different. We're spinning the records we listen to when we aren't listening to Latin alternative, and talking about how they've influenced the genre. The result is an eclectic mix â€” from Venezuelan salsa to Puerto Rican reggaeton and even some British prog rock.</p><p>I'm doubly excited because while co-host Felix Contreras is out on assignment, we're joined by my friend and esteemed colleague Ernesto Lechner. He co-hosts The Latin Alternative and writes for the LA Times. At one point during our soundcheck we were having some technical problems, and Ernesto (who spoke to us from KPCC in California) joked that it felt like he was talking to his cousin back home in Buenos Aires. There's a grain of truth in that, since Ernesto has always felt to me like an older cousin who astounds me with knowledge and fantastic storytelling. I can only hope to be as well versed in music as him when I grow up.</p><p>Yet the most important members of the Alt.Latino family are you guys, our audience. We want to know â€” when you aren't listening to the music we play, what genres are you simply unable to live without?</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Homenaje A Los ClÃ¡sicos: Salsa, Cumbia, Samba...

AquÃ? en Alt.Latino, tenemos poca paciencia para las personas que se adhieren a las normas. Celebramos aquellos artistas que unen gÃ©neros completamente distintos, y crean mezclas musicales nuevas, distintas y emocionantes.</p><p>Si le echan un vistazo a mi colecciÃ?n personal de mÃºsica, posiblemente se sorprendan. El rock latino solo es parte de mi ipod. TambiÃ©n escucho mucha salsa, reggaeton, cumbia, rap, pop y R&B de los aÃ±os 60. Estos son gÃ©neros sobre los cuÃ¡les tenemos pocas oportunidades de hablar en el programa, pero que realmente han influenciado la mÃºsica que solemos poner al aire.</p><p>Esta semana, vamos a hacer algo distinto: vamos a escuchar los discos que solemos escuchar cuando no estamos oyendo mÃºsica alternativa, y hablar sobre como estos gÃ©neros nos han influenciado. El resultado es una divertida mezcla de salsa venezolana, reggaetÃ?n Boricua y hasta rock progresivo de Inglaterra.</p><p>TambiÃ©n estoy muy contenta porque esta semana, ya que mi colega Felix Contreras esta de viaje, se une a nuestro elenco mi amigo y estimado colega Ernesto Lechner. Ernesto tiene un excelente programa de mÃºsica llamado The Latin Alternative y escribe para el diario Los Angeles Times. En un momento durante nuestra prueba de sonido tuvimos problemas tÃ©cnicos y Ernesto (que nos hablÃ? desde los estudios de KPCC en California) bromeÃ? que se sentÃ?a como si estuviese charlando con su prima en Buenos Aires. Como todo chiste, contiene algo de verdad, ya que siempre he sentido que Ernesto es como un primo mayor que comparte su inmenso conocimiento sobre la mÃºsica y sus fascinantes anÃ©cdotas.</p><p>Claro que los integrantes mÃ¡s importantes de nuestra familia son ustedes, nuestros oyentes.

And there are bands we hadn't heard of before  they were announced for these festivals, such as Colombian dance rockers Mr.  Bleat or Felix's new favorite, Hey Chica!</p><p>Today's show is a bit of an appetizer â€” the tip of the  iceberg, really. If you aren't already heading down south for some good music,  we encourage you to browse the festivals' websites. As always, we look forward  to your comments. Which band is a must-see? Who would you like to see  onstage?</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Viaje Al Centro De La MÃºsica: Lo Mejor de SXSW Y Vive Latino</p><p>Esta semana, producir el programa Alt.Latino fue bastante dificil. Nos estamos preparando para ir a dos grandes festivales de mÃºsica: SXSW en Austin, Texas y el Festival Vive Latino en Ciudad de MÃ©xico. La cantidad de mÃºsica en vivo que vamos a escuchar en las prÃ?ximas semanas es simplemente abrumadora.</p><p>Tenemos muchas ganas de ver algunas bandas bastante legendarias, como CafÃ© Tacvba y Molotov), y tambiÃ©n algunos mÃºsicos que siempre hemos deseado ver en vivo (personalmente me muero de ganas de ver a la banda chilena Astro, Francisca Valenzuela y a la cantante mexicana Carla Morrison). Por otro lado, tambiÃ©n habrÃ¡ bandas de las cuales jamÃ¡s habÃ?amos escuchado antes de estos festivales, tales como los rockeros colombianos de Mr. Bleat, o la nueva banda favorita de Felix, Hey Chica! de MÃ©xico.</p><p>El show de hoy es un aperitivo musical. Si no planeas ir a los festivales, espero que le eches un vistazo a sus sitios web. Y como siempre, aguardamos tus comentarios. Â¿Que banda no podemos perdernos? Â¿A quien te encantarÃ?a ver en vivo?

The piece begins with an initial melody, the Aria, followed by 30 short but brilliant variations built on eight notes Bach appears to have borrowed from Handel. Then Bach returns to that first, quiet and lovely melody.</p><p>There's nothing facile or formulaic about the variations, but Denk says they are linked by something deeper in music.</p><p>\"One of the most beautiful thing about the Goldbergs is that Bach uses it as a canvas in which to draw this seemingly infinite world of possibility,\" Denk says. \"He grabs from everybody; he basically does a mashup. He does things in the style of the French overture, in the style of different dances; he does lamenting â€” from the smallest to the largest, from the happiest to the saddest.\"</p><p>But even among these infinite possibilities, Bach managed to keep a connection between the variations â€” it's the same eight bass notes borrowed from Handel that threads all the music together.</p><p>\"This piece is a great example of one-upmanship in the history of music,\" says Denk. \"In 1733, Handel published 62 variations on a bass line ... and that's the same first eight bass notes of the Goldberg variations. And what Bach basically did is took those eight bass notes and multiplied it by four, because he thought it would be too monotonous [otherwise]. It's so much more profound, what Bach manages to do with these eight bass notes.\"</p><p>Denk says he is actually surprised by the Goldberg Variations' continued popularity, despite its length and the tremendous patience it takes to absorb the whole piece.</p><p>\"It's amazing how that piece has become iconic and a common thing, even in this very modern, Internet world,\" Denk says. \"It's a piece that lasts perhaps 70 or 80 minutes, and somehow that piece is still very relevant right now.\" [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]</p>"

MiloÅ¡ RepicknÃ? joined the two singers at  our trusty electric piano. </p><p>The festival has been strong on Puccini, thanks partly  to El-Khoury, whom I saw sing brilliantly in Suor Angelica and Gianni Schicchi two seasons ago. For this  Tiny Desk performance, she reprises her role of Lauretta in the latter opera by  singing the hit aria \"O mio babbino caro,\" in which she pleads with her father to  let her marry her boyfriend. Listen for El-Khoury's immaculate control of  dynamics. Her soft, pianissimo notes are silvery and well-supported by the  breath.</p><p>Jagde steps up next for a number from Puccini's Tosca â€” the opening tenor aria, \"Recondita  armonia\" â€” in which he muses about Tosca, his \"dark-eyed mistress.\" It takes a lot  of work to sing it right, and Jagde produces the requisite drama and decibels.</p><p>The two hard-working singers end with the deliciously  romantic duet which closes act one of Puccini's La BohÃ¨me. \"We've just fallen in love,\"  Jagde notes. \"It happens really quickly in the opera.\" As their two  powerful, love-struck voices intertwine, the sounds of Puccini reverberate off  the walls of the entire fifth floor â€” a good day in the office.</p><p>Set List:</p><p>undefined</p><p>Puccini: \"O mio  babbino caro\" (from Gianni  Schicchi)</p><p>Puccini:\" Recondita armonia\" (from Tosca)</p><p>Puccini: \"O soave  fanciulla\" (from La  BohÃ¨me)</p><p>undefined</p><p>Personnel:</p><p>undefined</p><p>Joyce  El-Khoury,  soprano</p><p>Brian  Jagde, tenor</p><p> MiloÅ¡ RepickÃ?,  piano</p><p>undefined</p><p>Credits:</p><p>Producer: Tom Huizenga; Editor: Michael Katzif; Videographers: Michael Katzif and Tucker Walsh; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait; photo by Emily Bogle/NPR</p><p>undefined</p><p>  [Copyright 2012 National Public Radio]</p>"
