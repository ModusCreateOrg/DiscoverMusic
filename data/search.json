In faster and choppier numbers, touring keyboardist Arild Werling (filling in for member Håkan Wirenstrand, who was back in Sweden with his family) hit all the '80s synthpop signifiers, even channeling Devo at times. While drummer Erik Bodin relentlessly kept the momentum up with both a drum set and electronic drum pad, bassist Fredrik Källgren Wallin added the structure for lead singer Yukimi Nagano's one-of-a-kind voice.</p><p>Nagano's fiery spirit mesmerized the crowd as she bounced about banging on acoustic and electronic percussion instruments many have never seen the likes of. While practically everyone couldn't help but move, Nagano brought the at-capacity Prospect Park Bandshell crowd to a standstill on the atypical slower number \"Twice,\" which showcases her impressive lower range.

Nothing wrong with that, but it was great to be reminded last night at Celebrate Brooklyn that there are still bands playing dance music the old school way: with multiple human beings and instruments being played in real time.</p><p>Hot Chip transitions seamlessly between songs, as they did heading from \"One Life Stand\" into \"Night And Day,\" which, even divorced from its recent video (which is totally bananas), is still a trippy, catchy piece of dance-pop. The band still does DJ shows, but they haven't given up on music as a performance art: Their live show is precise and polished. And again, there were plenty of echoes of earlier musical influences — fans of early Depeche Mode and New Order would have been very happy with the show last night. And fans of Fleetwood Mac who were on the ball might've noticed that band's \"Everywhere\" used as a kind of transition out of Hot Chip's own \"Ready For The Floor,\" one of a handful of older songs they played. (Most of the rest of the set came from the new album In Our Heads.)</p><p>Everything (including our broadcast) had been delayed by a summer storm that brought heavy rain, nickel-sized hailstones, and a dangerously impressive lightning display to the New York area. But Hot Chip made no concessions to the weather or the outdoor venue, accompanying their live music with a full-on, fairly intense light show.</p><p>The set was dancey but melodic, from a band that has always known how to have fun. And the sold-out audience (almost 8,000) had fun too. A walk around the back of the crowd turned up lots of people dancing their butts off. It may not have been a DJ set or a rave, but all the accoutrements of a major dance music event were there. And at the end of the set, Hot Chip invited the audience to join them for an actual DJ set at Santos Party House in lower Manhattan. For anyone with the time and the ability to squeeze in, the fun promised to last a lot longer.</p><p>The band will play NYC's Terminal 5 on Friday, July 20.

        "text"      : "<p>Few high-profile musicians could disappear into the SXSW crowd as seamlessly as Dan Deacon, who doesn't exactly cut a lithe, otherworldly, Mick Jagger-esque figure offstage. But everything about his set at Stubb's on Wednesday night was a raving, raging bundle of surprises: Deacon puts on some of the most rivetingly unpredictable, oddly interactive concerts in the business, whether he's teaching the crowd how to move in choreographed unison — witness the dance contest that precedes \"Konono Ripoff No. 1\" — or issuing a long spoken riff that somehow invokes both Avatar and the mom from the movie Big.</p><p>Bookended by busy drummers and looming over an array of technology that looks as if it could power a small spacecraft — not to mention a large glowing skull, film projections and a prolific assortment of blinking lights — Deacon serves as ringleader for a ludicrously overdriven orgy of sound. Naturally, lots went wrong along the way, from technical difficulties and language malfunctions to hastily recruited dancers Deacon publicly derided as inadequate. But the calamities aren't so much incidental as integral to a live act that's all about barely contained chaos.</p><p>Credits</p><p>Producers: Amy Schriefer, Robin Hilton; Video by: XI Media; Audio Engineer: Kevin Wait [Copyright 2013 NPR]</p>",
